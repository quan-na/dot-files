*over-control*
Controlling the breath is basic of zen/qi-gong training. When the breath is
controlled too much it become stiff and unnatural. Some time it 's good to let
go and observe the breath instead of controlling it. Train your instict of
breath so it can do the job while you 're busy with sonthing else.
*user-interface-that-is-alive*
Normal user interface are too still. They quickly response to user's input and
be still and do nothing till next input. This kind of design although being
popular and effective lack of life. Over times, user will get the feeling of
stress and lonelyness because they're working with a liveless machine. I want
the kind of interface that generate useless sound and movement part randomly,
part unwanted response to user input. This way the computer act like a living
creature and relieve the user from stress and lonelyness.

*the-bubble*

*better-vim*
I mapped nn and bb in insert mode for quicker jump to begining and end of line
. It has some problem with nnoremap, running, etc. but it is still worth since
I don't have to switch back and forth between normal mode and insert mode.

Micro web is a collection of processes that acts as a web server. 'Micro' as
in micro kernel. These process communcate wth each other using messages. Messa
-ges not only call functions but each message will be interprete as functions.
I want language of these messages is easy to interpreted, like fortran that
can do heavy calculation, and natively implement functional paterns.
Books I want to read:
 - Functional programming pattern
 - Lisp language
