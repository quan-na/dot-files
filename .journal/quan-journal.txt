*the-begin*
Today I start my journal to get daily though & experience written out. I do
this part for improving my memory, part for improving my writting skill.

*over-control*
Controlling the breath is basic of zen/qi-gong training. When the breath is
controlled too much it become stiff and unnatural. Some time it 's good to let
go and observe the breath instead of controlling it. Train your instict of
breath so it can do the job while you 're busy with something else.
*user-interface-that-is-alive*
Normal user interface are too still. They quickly response to user's input and
be still and do nothing till next input. This kind of design although being
popular and effective lack of life. Over times, user will get the feeling of
stress and lonelyness because they're working with a liveless machine. I want
the kind of interface that generate useless sound and movement part randomly,
part unwanted response to user input. This way the computer act like a living
creature and relieve the user from stress and lonelyness.

*colors-of-zen*
Color theme of sand, rock, wood, monk 's cloth, and pagoda wall. The colors
are chosen by budhism practisioner for their peaceful feeling.
*the-bubble*
Nature is like a bubble, leave alone and it will grow into perfect like a
circle, try to control and it will burst.

*better-vim*
I mapped nn and bb in insert mode for quicker jump to begining and end of line
. It has some problem with nnoremap, running, etc. but it is still worth since
I don't have to switch back and forth between normal mode and insert mode.
*start-readings-for-micro-web-project*
Micro-web is a collection of inter-dependence processes that communicate with
each other assnchronously using special crafted messages. I think of Micro-web
as an alternative for today bulky web servers. Even those server that
self-proclaimed as module-based are big bulky process which 's slow to start.
Micro in Micro-web get its meaning from micro kernels. By dividing the server
to many processes I hope it can be more agile and stable. Messages that are
sent between processes are not mearly function calls but they 're functions
themselves. The language in which those messages are written must be easy to
interpreted. There 'll be no symbols and just numbers as code instead. I want
a hybrid between Fortran and first-class function languages. The language must
be ready to do heavy calculations and support functional programming patterns.
Books I want to read:
 - Functional programming patterns : for functional patterns
 - Lisp language : an easy-to-inerpreted language
 - Fortran language : my first language, can do realy heavy calculations
==========================================================2015=02=10==========
*function-interface-pattern*
A pattern in object oriented programming which minic first class function in
functional languages. Doing this they can pass verbs instead of nouns in
method 's parameters.
*xmobar-disk*
xmobar - a status bar for xmonad - has disku and diskio for harddisk status
but it is not run smoothly when I try.
*first-time-with-haskell*
It turn out that haskell has several similar feature with my beloved prolog. I
'm trying to learn haskell in order to create text clock plugin for xmobar.

==========================================================2015=02=11==========
*haskell-non-strict-function*
Haskell has insteresting lazy native that allow normally infinite looped
functions to operate normally. As long as the error is not evaluated, it is
not an error.
*limited-memory-array-language*
I want micro-web message language to give same experience as the one I 've got
with Casio Fx3600P pocket calculator. Back then I manage to program it to
calculate matrix operations. The language will have la limited set of simbols
with specific range of addresses. This way it 'll be easier to interpret such
language.
*toward-text-clock*
mod and div in haskell has different meaning. To divide and modulus we must
use quot and rem respectively.

==========================================================2015=02=12==========
*too-much-resource*
Haskell package manager - cabal - use too much resource. 64MB RAM with 1GB
cache results in kernel panic. I'm considering building the packages myself.
*good-side-of-debian*
I find out that Debian has a really good support for building the source
packages. With just 1 command, we can download all the headers neccessary to
build a source package. I can finish the TextClock plugin without struggle
with bulky cabal.
>
    apt-get source xmonad
    dpkg-source -x xmobar_0.14-4.dsc
    apt-get build-dep xmobar

*reuse-of-functions*
Micro-web messages language should have some devices for reusing sent
messages. It will save some of bandwidth.
*textclock-plugin*
I finally finished the TextClock plugin for xmobar. It 's easier than I
thought at first. Next I want to add some color eye candy to the clock.
==========================================================2015=02=13==========
*the-code-passed-arround*
I 'm still persistent with the idea of passing the machine code between
processes. I have forgotten who I get that idea from, probably some one from
high school computer class. Because all processes in one computer share same
cpu architect, I don't know the reason why it 's impossible. Previous tries
have failed but I have successed in getting the function 's last instruction
pointer & copy the function code into writable memory space. In order to
proceed, I must find out why the JITs can generate code at runtime. There 're
3 Free project I have found:
 - OpenJDK : from java byte codes to machine code.
 - GNU Lightning : generate directly using assembly like syntax, probably most
  suitable one to read
 - IonMonkey : from javascript to machine code.
*asm.js*
While looking for IonMonkey, I found out about asm.js. It is a high
performance subset of javascript with the speed lack behind native compiler
only of factor of 2. It seem really interesting and I want apply it to
Micro-web frontend.
==========================================================2015=02=14==========
*nerd-tree*
I found out nerdtree in searching for some plugins to help viewing code in
vim. Too busy in Seagame-VMS so I will try install it later.
==========================================================2015=02=15==========
*busy-cleaning-up-the-flat*
There 're a lot to do before leaving the flat for the Tet vacation. We must
leave it for 1 week period so all the electrical devices must be unpluged,
furnitures must be cover, and dust must be wept so there won't be a mess when
we come back after the vacation.
==========================================================2015=02=16==========
*join-the-making-of-banh-tet*
My family hadn't got tradition of making banh tet in Tet holiday until my
parents started it. The results are not always good and they 're not always
consumed all but the process of getting the family members joined in labour of
making something is always good. It strengthens the bound between us. And this
is the reason it became a tradition of my family.
==========================================================2015=02=17==========
*camera-zoom-and-angle*
By standing up or couching down, I can change the angle in which the camera
capturing the subject. With that, sometime we can hide un-wanted object or
show more details on the subject. I tried this at Tran Bien Spring Garden and
be impressed how it worked.
==========================================================2015=02=18==========
*padded-side-stand*
The side stands always leave bikes in slant angle to give them better balance.
This is useful outdoor but indoor it 's waste of space. A slant bike usually
take 15-20 cm more than center stand but the center stand requires more force
to work. By padding the side stand so that the bike is in standing position we
can save spaces with less force.
*resume-qigong-study*
Learned the lesson of overly-control, I want to resume my study on qi-gong. Up
until now, I have only learned about ren and du mai, and vaguely points in
these two channel. It's time to learning exactly where the points are and
expand my knowledge to others in the 8 odd channels.
==========================================================2015=02=19==========
*mac-harddrive-dead*
The mac book pro that sstvn gave me can not boot anymore. The reason is that
the harddrive is badly damaged. Days ago, it kept putting I/O error in kernel
buffer. I tried various methods but software methods can never work on
hardware issues. So now I turns off the power and wait for a miracle (or a new
harddrive).
*n4s-rx8*
Recently, the desktop at home (in Bien Hoa) always crashes when I play 3D
games. I find out that the small fan on its graphic card does not work
anymore. After removing that small fan and substitute it with a fan gotten
from old mainboard that my cousin gave me the desktop does not crash anymore.
I immediately open Need for Speed and try out a new car. The Mazda RX8 in real
life is a car with rotary engine, there 's no way this fact is simulated in
the game but they tuned the parameter to create very good handling for this
car in game. It turn out much better than the muscle Ford Mustang that I tried
earlier.

*process-of-learning*
The process of learning is already to familiar to us, not just learner but to
everyone. We start learning from the day we was born and continue either
formal or passive through our jobs, our everyday activities. Yet the process
is still kind of unfamiliar, kind of mistery. Perhaps it is because each of us
perceive this process in different ways.
Mine came from a model I built up after AI course at university. Back then, I
believe a person's knowledge consists of two sets: rules, and facts. Facts are
what that person experienced with his own senses. Rules are what he deduced
from facts and other rules.
The truth values of facts and rules depend on the truth values of those that
are connected to them.
