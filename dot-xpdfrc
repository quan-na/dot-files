#
# System-wide xpdfrc file
#
# Xpdf looks for a config file in the following two places:
# 1. ~/.xpdfrc
# 2. /etc/xpdf/xpdfrc
#
# Note that if ~/.xpdfrc exists, Xpdf will NOT read the system
# configuration file /etc/xpdf/xpdfrc. You may wish to include it
# from your ~/.xpdfrc using:
#    include /etc/xpdf/xpdfrc
# and then add additional settings.
#
# For complete details on config file syntax and available options, 
# please see the xpdfrc(5) man page.
